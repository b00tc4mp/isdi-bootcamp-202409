### Dive and Discover App Overview

Dive and Discover is an innovative app designed to connect scuba divers with dive centers worldwide while offering comprehensive insights into local marine life. The app is tailored for two distinct user types: **Divers** and **Dive Centers**, providing features to enhance their diving adventures and operational efficiency.

#### Key Features

**For Divers:**  
- A **Home Section** with personalized information, including name, username, email, profile picture, password reset, and equipment size preferences.  
- A **Settings Menu** to update and manage personal details easily.  
- A **Dive Logbook** for recording dive history, including date, location, depth, and notes.  
- Access to detailed information about underwater life in specific areas, featuring photos and descriptions of local marine species.

**For Dive Centers:**  
- A dedicated **Home Section** displaying essential details such as the center’s name, address, opening hours, website link, and a photo.  
- A **Settings Menu** to update and manage the dive center’s profile information efficiently.

#### Discover Section

The **Discover Section** is the heart of the app, enabling users to search for dive locations by city or region. Upon selecting a location, users will find:  
1. A **Dive Center List** in the selected area, with detailed profiles to help divers choose and contact their preferred dive center.  
2. A second screen offering educational content about the area’s marine ecosystem. This section features vivid images and descriptions of sea creatures, helping divers familiarize themselves with the local biodiversity before their dive.

#### Vision

Dive and Discover bridges the gap between scuba diving enthusiasts and dive centers while fostering awareness and appreciation of marine life. Whether you’re an experienced diver or exploring the underwater world for the first time, this app ensures you’re informed, connected, and prepared for your next adventure.
